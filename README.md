# Go_Moves
A lightweight, terminal-based implementation of the classic strategy game Go, written in Python. This project focuses on clean turn-based logic and real-time board rendering in the console.
Features
Dynamic 9x9 Board: Features a clear grid with alphabetical (A-I) and numerical (1-9) coordinate systems.

Two-Player Local Multiplayer: Supports alternating turns between White (○) and Black (●) stones.

Move Validation: Prevents players from placing stones on occupied points and validates input formatting (e.g., "A5").

Clean UI: Uses screen-clearing to refresh the board state after every move, providing a seamless gameplay experience.

Game Rules (Included)
When a stone is placed, it must be placed on an empty point.

Players take turns until someone enters 'stop'.
